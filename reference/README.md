# Creating Reference Documentation

After the specifications have been merged in the [azure-rest-api-specs repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs), you can use [this template](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/CSI/Content%20Production%20Service/_workitems/create/User%20Story?templateId=d6e16b15-930c-4bf5-9b42-7faf39a85d99) for a VSTS user story to request an update to the reference docs.
